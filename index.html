    <p> I am excited about learning the front end of development! This is
      really cool how quickly you can create a website. Since this is my
      profile let me tell you a little bit about me. I was born and raised in
      Ausitn, Texas. I enjoy reading, working out, and spending time with my
      family. My background is in education. I have a bachelors in education
      and a masters in reading education. I have ten years of experience in the
      classroom.

    </p>
    <p> I am learning a lot. Here is the website that helped me learn.
